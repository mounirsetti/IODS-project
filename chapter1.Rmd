*It's a great project*

With all of these preparations (installing GitHub, connecting it with RStudio, using Datacamp etc.), I feel that this course is going to give me a proper introduction to the main tools of the trade in the fancy world of data science.
Maybe I have already learned enough today. I will leave getting familiar with R Markdown to another day.
